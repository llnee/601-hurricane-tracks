The project uses NOAAâ€™s Historical Hurricane Track Dataset found here (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-best-track-archive).
The Historical Hurricane Track Dataset contains data on every hurricane since the mid 1800s, such as where the hurricane
 was located, what wind speed it had, distance to land, etc. It also contains data on various reporting agencies for the
 hurricane statistics; different agencies report different information, even for the same hurricane.

 Data was inserted into tables using the csv files from NOAA and the converter found here (https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-sql.htm).
 Data was only inserted for the past 3 years as of 2023 to minimize execution time.
